# ColombianArcheologicalArchive

Android app showing info on many colombian/pre-colombian archeological artefacts

Using Retrofit, the app loads data in JSON format from an open data website (https://www.datos.gov.co/) 
and places it in its own SQLite database.

The user can see the list of all artefacts. Clicking on one of them leads to more details about this artefact.
The user can also apply filters to display the data (type of object and location of discovery) .
